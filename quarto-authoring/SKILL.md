# Quarto Authoring

Use this skill for manuscript editing and rendering.

## When to use

- "update qmd"
- "render manuscript"
- "fix quarto output"

## Quick commands

```bash
quarto render manuscript/sciclaw-manuscript-outline.qmd --to html
quarto render manuscript/sciclaw-component-revision-plan.qmd --to html
```

## Workflow

1. Update narrative sections to match implemented code and tests.
2. Keep methods and results claims tied to concrete artifacts.
3. Render after edits and check for warnings/errors.
4. Record manuscript deltas in plan activity/log files.
