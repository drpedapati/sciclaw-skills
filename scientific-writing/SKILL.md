# Scientific Writing

Use this skill when the task is manuscript drafting or revision for technical/scientific content.

## When to use

- "update the manuscript"
- "write methods/results/discussion"
- "tighten scientific language"
- "align claims to evidence"

## Workflow

1. Start from repository artifacts (code, logs, benchmarks) before drafting claims.
2. Separate facts from hypotheses and future work.
3. Keep claims bounded to what is implemented and tested.
4. Record unresolved questions explicitly.

## Output checklist

- Claims map to concrete evidence in the repo.
- Methods are reproducible (commands, files, assumptions).
- Limitations and uncertainty are stated.
- Next-step experiments are listed with acceptance criteria.
